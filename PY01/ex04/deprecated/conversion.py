# Explanation
# Element of the array before conversion:
#     The value of the pixel in the NumPy array before conversion is 100.

# Element of the array after conversion:
#     After conversion to uint8, the value of the pixel remains 100. This is because the original value fits within a byte.

# Memory representation of the element before conversion:
#     Before conversion, the pixel value is represented as a 4-byte value (d\x00\x00\x00) followed by 4 null bytes (\x00\x00\x00\x00). This is because NumPy uses a default 32-bit data type (int32), so each array element occupies 4 bytes in memory.

# Memory representation of the element after conversion:
#     After conversion to uint8, the pixel value is represented as a single byte, which is d in ASCII. This is because uint8 uses only 1 byte to represent each pixel value, resulting in a more compact memory representation.
